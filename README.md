# Alphaneural React Assessment

This is a small React project completed as part of a technical assessment for **[alphaneural.io](https://alphaneural.io)**.

## Description

The task was to fetch and display a list of products from a public API (`https://dummyjson.com/products`). For each product, the following information is rendered:

* Thumbnail image
* Product title
* Original price
* Discounted price (if applicable)

If a discount is present:

* The original price is shown with a `strike` class
* The discounted price is calculated and displayed next to it

No additional styling or UI work was requiredâ€”only the functional implementation.
